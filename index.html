	<p>I'm a student at CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism, hoping to become an investigative reporter. I want to produce work that holds powerful systems accountable and redistributes power to communities through knowledge and access to information.</p>
	<p>Here are three pieces of journalism I admire:</p>
	<ol>
		<div class="title">
		<li><b>The Shadow Penal System for Struggling Kids</b>, by Rachel Aviv – <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/18/the-shadow-penal-system-for-struggling-kids"target="_blank">The New Yorker</a>.</li>
	</div>
		<p>This story exposes “troubled teen” programs that abuse and neglect the kids they claim to help. I appreciate how Aviv centers the kids’ experiences with respect and empathy,  and seeks to hold harmful institutions accountable.</p>
		<div class="title">
		<li><b>It’s Bisan From Gaza, I’m Still Alive</b>, by Bisan Owda – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZd3QRtSy5LP4IgJ3sX2LhF3tuBbFFbKJ"target="_blank">AJ+.</a></li>
	</div>
		<p>Owda reports from Gaza under extremely dangerous conditions, documenting a genocide by a military that has killed hundreds of journalists and restricted independent coverage. Her reporting is courageous, essential, and far-reaching.</p>
		<div class="title">
		<li><b>The Giant Pool of Money</b>, by Alex Blumberg & Adam Davidson – <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/355/the-giant-pool-of-money"target="_blank">This American Life</a>.</li>
	</div>
		<p>I first listened to this story at seventeen, when I had little interest in or understanding of the economy. It helped me make sense of the 2008 financial crisis, the people behind it, and the decisions that caused it. I like how it uses storytelling to explain complex financial systems while keeping nuance intact.</p>
